# DocsProvider (Planned)

The **DocsProvider** project is designed to set up an **MkDocs-based documentation service** for the Mirama project management platform. Its goal is to provide a simple, centralized way to visualize diagrams, architecture and design decisions for both the backend and frontend of the platform.

## Purpose

- Host and organize project documentation using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
- Provide clear diagrams and architecture overviews.
- Document key design decisions and workflows.
- Serve as a single reference for both backend and frontend developers.
