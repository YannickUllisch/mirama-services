# Deployment & Infrastructure

All services are containerized using **Docker**, with deployment infrastructure planned using **Terraform**, modeled after real world cloud environments.

While the microservices are not currently deployed due to cost constraints, the infrastructure design and deployment strategy are still documented. This reflects a common real world limitation and demonstrates an understanding of both technical and financial trade-offs.

The original application remains actively deployed using a cost-effective platform-as-a-service solution.
