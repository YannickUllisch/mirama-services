## Welcome to My Projects & Documentation

Hi, I’m Yannick. 👋  

This is the central hub for the documentation of my personal and professional projects. Its purpose is to give you a clear view of the work I’ve done, the systems I’ve designed and the platforms I maintain, all in one place.

---

## Current Focus: The Mirama Platform

The first project documented here is the **Mirama Platform** which is a multi-service application with a **backend** and **frontend** structure. Here, you can explore:

- **Backend Services** – including the `AuthService` and `AccountService`, with architecture, security and system design details.  
- **Frontend Components** – how the client-facing interface is structured and integrated with the backend services.  

This documentation provides insights into how the platform is organized, the technologies used and the design decisions behind each component.

## Future Documentation

While the Mirama Platform is the primary project documented now, the goal is to expand this hub to include:

- Other personal platforms I develop
- Open-source projects
- Research or experimental prototypes

The vision is to provide a **comprehensive view of my technical work**, from code structure to system architecture, in an accessible and navigable format.

## How to Use This Site

- Use the **sidebar navigation** to explore each project and its submodules.  
- Each page includes explanations, architecture diagrams, and code snippets to make it easier to understand the structure and functionality.

Thank you for visiting. I hope this gives you a clear picture of my work, both in depth and breadth.
